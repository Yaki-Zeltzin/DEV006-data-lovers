## DESIGN

We've design an intuitive website that is not overcrowded by information.

The navigation buttons are easy to spot in the middle of our website and the background is darker than the text so it's easier to read.

We've customized the layout to fulfill our user's requirements.

There are three pages: main, movies and characters.

The colors and fonts are based on Ghibli's images and colors. We tried to keep it simple and intuitive.
